# reinforcement-learning-algorithms
This repository contains implementations of fundamental Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms, starting with the **multi-armed bandit problem**. The goal is to provide a hands-on understanding of RL concepts and their practical applications. As the repository evolves, it will include more advanced RL techniques, environments, and projects.

## Current Features

### Multi-Armed Bandit Problem

The multi-armed bandit is a classic RL problem where the agent must decide which arm of a slot machine to pull to maximize rewards. The following approaches are implemented:

1. **Epsilon-Greedy**: Balances exploration and exploitation by selecting a random action with probability ε and the best-known action otherwise.
2. **Optimistic Initial Values**: Encourages initial exploration by starting with optimistic estimates for action values.
3. **Upper Confidence Bound (UCB)**: Selects actions based on upper confidence bounds to balance exploration and exploitation.
4. **Gradient-Based Bandits**: Uses a softmax policy to learn preferences for actions.
5. **Non-Stationary Bandits**: Handles scenarios where reward distributions change over time using techniques like a sliding window or exponential recency-weighted averages.
